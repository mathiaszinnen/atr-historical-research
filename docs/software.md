# Useful research software

In our Bring Your Own Data Lab workshop in February 2025, we discussed that (high-quality) OCR may not be necessary for all research purposes and that sometimes image annotation
(of the source scans) and digital aids to speed-up annotation writing can already bring many projects a big step forward. Below is a (far from complete) list of recommended research software that you could check out:

## Tools for image manipulation

- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) (free and open source image editor)
- [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/) (open source software for processing and analysing scientific images)

## Scanning for mobile devices

- [OpenScan](https://github.com/ethereal-developers/OpenScan) (open-source, privacy-friendly Document Scanner app)

## Document / image annotation and qualitative analysis

- [cvat.ai](https://www.cvat.ai/) (data engine for machine learning to annotate images)
- [LabelStudio](https://labelstud.io/) (tool for annotating images, includes a workflow to semi-automatically annotate texts to generate descriptions)
- [Atlas.ti](https://atlasti.com/) (tool for qualitative data analysis, including options to create visualisations based on tags and free text)
- [NVivo](https://lumivero.com/products/nvivo/) (qualiative research software)

## Platforms for citizen science (e.g. OCR post-correction or volunteer transcriptions)

- [Omeka](https://omeka.org/) (open-source web publishing platforms for sharing digital collections and creating media-rich online exhibits)
- [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/) ("platform for people-powered research")

## GDPR-compliant speech-to-text tools

- [noScribe](https://github.com/kaixxx/noScribe) (uses OpenAIs Whisper for automated audio transcription) 
- [aTrain](https://github.com/JuergenFleiss/aTrain) (GUI tool for offline transcription of speech recordings, including speaker diarisation)
